# myhike
My Hike is sort of like a social network meets wikipedia meets public database.
This site allows nature enthusiasts to share their favorite spots and foragers
their best finds, and also provides a public database of species dispersal
to measure the effects of climate change on different ecosystems.

## mobile compatibility
I know web design is mobile-first, but part of this project was to experiment using
the [shoji](https://crashspringfield.github.io/shoji/) component I wrote. The next phase
of this project will most-likely be building a mobile-friendly version, either with
React-Native, or detecting screen to render a mobile- or desktop-friendly viewport.

## contributing
This is an ongoing project, so this is as much as a personal to-do list as it's a
list of ways anyone interested can help:

      - allowing users to edit own (but not others') hike reviews
      - private options (users can see only their hike)
      - email verification and lost password re-submission
      - making descriptions/animals/plants/fungi searchable
      - adding markers via address, user's current location, etc.
      - mobile compatibility
